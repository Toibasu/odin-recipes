Learning through TOP
Committing to learnig webdev through The Odin Project.
Going to learn this by using the terminal as much as humanly possible.
This is for me to easily be able to transition to other platforms such as powershell.
The goal of all this is to be able to get a new job as either a IT-Tech or programmer of some kind.

    Projects Done: None
    Languages that I want to learn: Python, Javascript(HTML/CSS)
